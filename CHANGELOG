  Features
  --------
  - Extract mobile apps (*.apk) from compressed archives (i.e. zip, 7z,
    rar, tar, tar.gz) protected with or without a common password
    (i.e. infected, infected666, infected666<last-digit-before-extension>).
  - Scrapes out APK files thanks to an efficient composite heuristic
    by mean of checking magic number and the existence of apk well-known
    resources; non-matching files are removed before analyzing their
    digital trails.
  - Save every extracted mobile app in the out folder; each file is renamed
    to its md5 hash.
